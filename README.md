Grocery List in Reactjs

This ReactJS app uses History and Universal Router to allow the user to change to a different page, such as creating a new item.

It allows a user to add an item to a list, edit the item, have the item be in either a "Shopping List" or a "Avalible List". 

Would be connect to a backend via API calls.
